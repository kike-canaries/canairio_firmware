A citizen science project that employs both mobile and fixed sensors to measure air quality (PM 2.5 or CO2) and environmental variables. This is achieved using low-cost sensors and smartphones. The project is built around an ESP32 module board integrated with the [CanAirIO Android client app](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_android).

# Installation alternatives

We have different alternatives to load the current firmware. By complexity order, they are:

## Via CanAirIO Web Installer (RECOMMENDED)

If you already have a ESP32 board, you can test our CanAirIO firmware on one click, with our web installer:

[![canairio web installer on m5stickcplus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/423856/152767232-81c11957-26f0-4a83-bf63-6a4bee41a168.gif)](https://youtu.be/TdX1AZ4PzBA)  
[Full video](https://youtu.be/TdX1AZ4PzBA) - [Web installer](https://canair.io/installer.html)

## Via CanAirIO loader

You will able to install the last version of CanAirIO firmware using a simple Arduino sketch that it will doing all for you, you only need to use the official [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [Arduino Droid app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.antonsmirnov.android.arduinodroid2&hl=en&gl=US) for load this [simple sketch](https://github.com/hpsaturn/esp32-canairio-loader/blob/master/canairio_loader/canairio_loader.ino). Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/hpsaturn/esp32-canairio-loader) or follow the next [YouTube video guide](https://youtu.be/FjfGdnTk-rc) for Android OTG installation alternative.

## Via binaries

You can download the last firmware version in [releases](https://github.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/releases) section. For example, download the last **production** release from `assets` section, like this:  

![releases assets](images/assets.jpg)

please uncompress the zip file and connect your CanAirIO device to your USB and execute the next command to upload the firmware to your board, for example for an ESP32DevKit board you should run the next commands:

### Linux and MacOSx

``` bash
unzip canairio_rev414_20190829.zip
cd canairio_installer
esptool --port /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000 write_flash 0x0 canairio_ESP32DEVKIT_rev932_merged.bin
```

(You should install [esptool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/installation.html) in your system.)

### Windows

Please read the [Espressif Uploader](https://canair.io/docs/firmware_upload.html#espressif-uploader) section in the main documentation to have details of how load the firmware via the official **Espressif Download Tool** in Windows.

## Via PlatformIO (Compiling on Linux, Mac or Windows)

Please install first [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) open source ecosystem for IoT development compatible with **Arduino** IDE and its command line tools (Windows, MacOs and Linux). Also, you may need to install [git](http://git-scm.com/) in your system.

For the **default** board `TTGO_TDISPLAY` (CanAirIO Bike), clone and upload firmware via USB cable:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware
cd canairio_firmware
pio run --target upload
```

For a specific firmware for example for a TTGO-T7 board, only change the last line for:

``` bash
pio run -e TTGO_T7 --target upload
```

## Via Docker

First build the Docker image using the following command line:

```bash
docker build -t canairio_pio:master .
```

This build a basic compiler image with all PlatformIO stuff. For build the project you only needs now run:

```bash
./docker_build run
```

## OTA WAN updates

CanAirIO offers two channels for remote OTA (Over-The-Air) updates for your device: the production channel and the development channel. This means you won't need to reinstall the firmware manually for any updates; it's all automatic. You only need to have Wi-Fi enabled on your device to receive these firmware updates.

If you're interested in the latest testing updates, please go to the releases section and choose and download the development firmware (a zip file with `dev` in its name), then upload it to your board to receive these kind of updates.

## Box STL files

** W A R N N I N G **

The last versions for all box versions, are in the [official repository](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware/tree/master/box) because it is more easy for handling the versions than Thingiverse.
